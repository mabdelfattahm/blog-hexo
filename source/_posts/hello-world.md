title: Hello World
---
Welcome to my blog! This is my very first post. 

I am not usually the typing type of people but here we are. I will be talking mainly about tech stuff and maybe rant a litte about football and my day-to-day interactions.

This wouldn't be a hello world post without some code. Here's a hello world snippet written in Kotlin 

```kotlin
fun main() = println("Hello, World!")
```

and in Java

```java
public void main(String... args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, World!");
}
```

See you in the next one.
